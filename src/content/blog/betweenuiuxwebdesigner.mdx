## Designer Roles in Mexico: Categories, Clarity, and Salary Ranges

The field of design in Mexico has experienced a remarkable evolution with increasing digitalization, leading to a diversity of specialized roles that sometimes cause confusion. Understanding the distinctions between these functions is crucial for both those seeking to develop professionally in the area and employers looking for specific talent.

### What is a Designer? The Diversity of Roles

Traditionally, designers were associated with visual communication and aesthetics, focused on print media such as posters or packaging. This role is defined as a **Graphic Designer**, whose objective is to effectively transmit messages and emotions through visual elements. Their core skills include creativity, mastery of design theory (typography, color, composition), and proficiency in software like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign.

With the advent of the digital environment, new specializations emerged:

- **Web Designer:** Focuses on the functionality and aesthetics of websites, seeking a visually pleasing structure and content. Their tasks include the visual design of pages, layout, and creation of graphic elements for the web, often collaborating with developers. They possess skills in web visual design, understanding of user flow, and basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript.
- **UI Designer (User Interface):** Is responsible for creating the graphical parts that the user interacts with directly in applications and websites. Their goal is to make these digital products visually attractive and easy to navigate. They perform tasks such as organizing layouts, choosing color palettes and fonts, designing interactive elements, and creating high-fidelity mockups. They work together with UX designers and developers.
- **UX Designer (User Experience):** Centers their work on the complete experience the user has with a product, whether digital or not, seeking to make it functional, accessible, and pleasant to use. Their typical tasks include user research, development of user profiles, creation of user journey maps, wireframes, prototypes, and user testing. They focus on how the interaction makes the user feel.
- **Digital Designer:** This term is broader and can encompass professionals who work with digital media in general, potentially including aspects of graphic, web, UI, and UX design. A digital designer may have a broader skill set covering several of these specializations.

While there are clear distinctions between these roles, the field of digital design is dynamic and presents areas of overlap. A web designer may require graphic design skills, and a UI designer needs to understand web development principles. The extent of this overlap varies depending on the project and team size; in small companies, it is common for a professional to cover multiple roles.

### Potential Salary Ranges in Mexico

Salary ranges for designers in Mexico vary according to experience, specialization, geographical location, and type of employer. Data suggests that specializations in high-demand digital areas, such as UX/UI, tend to have higher compensation compared to general graphic design.

According to available information, the estimated monthly and annual salary ranges for graphic designers in Mexico based on their experience level are as follows:

| Experience Level Â  Â  Â   | Estimated Monthly Salary (MXN)  | Estimated Annual Salary (MXN) |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------ | :---------------------------- |
| Recent Graduate Â  Â  Â  Â  | \$7,000-\$12,000 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â   | \$84,000-\$144,000 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â   |
| Junior (1-3 years) Â  Â   | \$10,000-\$18,000 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  | \$120,000-\$216,000 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  |
| Mid-Level (3-7 years)   | \$18,000-\$30,000 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  | \$216,000-\$360,000 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  |
| Senior (7+ years) Â  Â  Â  | \$30,000+ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  | \$360,000+ Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â   |

It's important to consider that these are estimates and may vary. Information from Coursera suggests that UX designers in Mexico could have an average annual salary of \$240,000 MXN, while UI designers could reach \$204,000 MXN annually. Graphic designers reported monthly salaries between \$7,000 and \$10,000 MXN in 2022, while UX designers were between \$16,000 and \$28,149 MXN monthly during the same period.

Factors such as experience level, specialization in high-demand areas (digital, UX/UI, branding, animation), academic background, a strong portfolio, updated technical skills, geographical location (large cities typically have higher salaries), and the size and type of company significantly influence compensation.
